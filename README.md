# SimpleChainJS

SimpleChainJS is a basic blockchain implementation using JavaScript (Node.js). It provides a simple and easy-to-understand example of how a blockchain works.

## Features

- Blocks with timestamp and data
- Blockchain integrity verification
- SHA256 hashing for block security

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/simplechain-js.git
   cd simplechain-js
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the example:

   ```bash
   node blockchain.js
   ```

   This will create a simple blockchain with a few blocks and output the blockchain data along with its validity check.

## Usage

Feel free to experiment with the code, add more blocks, and explore the world of blockchain development using this simple example.
